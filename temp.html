            <h2> Please do NOT book anything yet! We hit a little bump on the road with preparations. Please hang tight while we get everything sorted out. There will still be a wedding in Mexico, but there may be a change in the city. We will keep everyone up to date on the status. Thank you!</h2>
            <p> One last thing, please continue the process of getting any travel documents ready.</p>
